# Advanced Networking 

This repository contains **Advanced Networking labs** implemented and tested in **EVE-NG**.  
It is designed for hands-on learning, revision, and real-world scenario practice.

---

## EIGRP

- Lab setups, topologies, and configurations for **EIGRP**.
- Focus: Neighbor formation, metric calculation, summarization, and troubleshooting.
- Examples: IPv4, IPv6, EIGRP named mode.

## OSPFv2

- Labs for **OSPFv2** in IPv4 networks.
- Topics: Area design, DR/BDR election, SPF calculation, and network optimization.

## OSPFv3

- Labs for **OSPFv3** in IPv6 networks.
- Topics: Interface configuration, neighbor adjacency, and multi-area design.

## BGP

- Labs covering **Basic BGP setup**.
- Topics: iBGP, eBGP, neighbor configuration, and routing table verification.

## Advanced BGP

- Labs for advanced BGP features.
- Topics: Route filtering, prefix-lists, route-maps, and policy-based routing.

## BGP Path Selection

- Hands-on practice with **BGP path selection rules**.
- Topics: Local preference, AS path, MED, weight, and tie-breakers.

## Mid Revision

- A set of labs to **review and consolidate knowledge** learned so far.
- Includes scenario-based troubleshooting exercises.

## Route Redistribution

- Labs on **redistributing routes** between different protocols.
- Topics: EIGRP ↔ OSPF, OSPF ↔ BGP, and metric manipulation.

## MPLS VPN

- Labs for **MPLS VPN implementation**.
- Topics: VRFs, RD/RT, MPLS labeling, and inter-site communication.

## DMVPN

- Labs for **Dynamic Multipoint VPN**.
- Topics: Hub-and-spoke, spoke-to-spoke, NHRP, and tunneling.

## Advanced DMVPN

- Extended DMVPN labs.
- Topics: Redundancy, dual-hub design, multiple phases, and troubleshooting.

## Final Revision

- Comprehensive labs combining all topics.
- Scenario-based exercises for **full network design, configuration, and verification**.
